"""The network boundary: what the transport model hands over, and what comes back.

Everything below this interface is the network's business (queueing, scheduling,
delay, loss, ECN marking). Everything above it is transport and application. The
two implementations are `LoopbackLink`, a deterministic Python bottleneck used to
develop and test without an emulator, and `FikoreLink`, which drives FikoRE.

The interface deliberately reports what happened to each segment and nothing else.
It never tells the sender that a segment was lost: only the receiver sees arrivals,
so the sender discovers loss the way TCP does, from acknowledgements and timers.
