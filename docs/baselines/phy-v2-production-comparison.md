# Original Baseline versus Production PHY Model V2

Both inputs use whole-run metrics. This is a characterization of the combined approved configuration, PHY, PF, O2I, and map changes; it is not a one-factor causal attribution.

This combined table is not the map-catalog ablation. The paired legacy-v1 versus padded-v2.1 comparison is reported separately in `map-v2.1-paired-profile-comparison.md`.
