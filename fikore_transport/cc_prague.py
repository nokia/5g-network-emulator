"""Prague, bound to the L4S reference implementation rather than reimplemented.

The controller is `prague_cc.cpp` from the L4S team's `udp_prague`, compiled into
`prague/libpraguesim.so` with its clock overridden to read simulated time. See
`prague/prague_shim.cpp` for why binding was preferred to porting.

What this file does is translate between two vocabularies. The sender speaks bytes,
segments and a congestion window; Prague speaks a pacing rate, a window in packets
and the four counters a receiver echoes back. The translation is mechanical, but
two points are decisions and are marked as such below: the initial rate, and what
happens on duplicate acknowledgements.
