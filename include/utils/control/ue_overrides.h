// ue_overrides(): per-UE runtime control state. Plain data, owned by the ue it belongs
// to, contiguous and free of pointers, so that reading it from the scheduling hot path
// costs one scalar load.
//
// Writing: only control_manager::tick(), at the start of simulator::step(), where every
// worker thread of the pools is quiescent. Never from the socket thread and never from
// inside a parallel phase.
//
// Reading: each subsystem at its own point of consumption, by value. Nothing keeps a
// pointer to this struct: ue_handler::add_ues grows a std::vector<ue> without reserve,
// so any pointer taken during construction would dangle after a reallocation.
//
// Arrays indexed by tx_dir: 0 = TX_DL, 1 = TX_UL (common/direction.h).
