# Offline Analysis Report

This report summarizes the standard plots generated for the latest offline FikoRE run.

## MAC Plots

### Downlink Throughput vs Time
File: [mac/dl_throughput.png](mac/dl_throughput.png)

Shows the downlink throughput over time for the scheduled UEs. When available, it also includes the modified Shannon limit as a rough capacity reference.

### CDF of Normalized UE Throughput
File: [mac/cdf_throughput.png](mac/cdf_throughput.png)

Shows the cumulative distribution of average UE throughput. It is useful for checking fairness and throughput spread across users.

## UE Plots

### UE Trajectories
File: [ue/trajectory.png](ue/trajectory.png)

Shows the movement of all UEs in the simulated scenario, including their start and end points and the base station position.

### SINR Histogram
File: [ue/sinr_hist_ul_dl.png](ue/sinr_hist_ul_dl.png)

Shows the distribution of uplink and downlink SINR samples for each UE. It is useful for comparing radio quality and variability.

### RSRP Histogram
File: [ue/rsrp_hist_ul_dl.png](ue/rsrp_hist_ul_dl.png)

Shows the distribution of uplink and downlink RSRP samples for each UE. It gives a direct view of received power conditions.
