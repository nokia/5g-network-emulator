"""The lockstep loop: one slot, one pass, in a fixed order.

Order inside slot n:

  1. the network reports what became terminal up to n
  2. receivers turn arrivals into acknowledgements
  3. acknowledgements that are due at n reach their sender, and timers fire
  4. senders are asked for their segments, which are handed over for slot n+1
  5. the network is allowed to run slot n+1

Nothing in step 4 can depend on anything the network does after step 1, which is
the property that makes the run causally correct: a segment sent as a reaction to
an acknowledgement always leaves at least one slot after the arrival that caused it.
