# V2 Candidate Map Comparison

## Scope

The v2 generator was used to create 21 deterministic candidate maps with
master seed `20260927`, including the new exact 2.38 GHz UMi map.

No production map was replaced. Comparison runs select candidate maps through
the explicit `map_file` scenario setting.

Changes represented together in these candidates:

- corrected UMa UE-height LOS term;
- correlated binary LOS state;
- odd 291×291 grid with an explicit centre cell;
- deterministic Python DFT-based shadow realization;
- approved exact-frequency catalog.

ABG coefficient values are unchanged.

## Spatial map comparison

Twenty thousand common spatial samples were evaluated for each map that has a
legacy counterpart.

The complete results are in
[`map-v2-spatial-deltas.csv`](map-v2-spatial-deltas.csv).

General observations:

- median gain deltas are typically within approximately ±4 dB;
- realization-to-realization P5/P95 differences frequently exceed ±10 dB;
- open-office candidates show the largest positive upper-tail changes;
- UMi 3.5 has a median delta near -4 dB against its current legacy
  realization;
- pointwise RMSE includes both approved semantic changes and an independent
  stochastic realization, so it is not a regression tolerance.

## Canonical profile comparison

Both run batches use:

- identical code;
- seed `20260927`;
- identical traffic, mobility, power, scheduler, and duration;
- 180 simulated seconds per profile.

Only the selected map catalog changes.

## Interpretation

1. UMi, UMa, and indoor aggregate effects are moderate for this seed.
2. RMa changes materially: approximately +3 dB mean DL SINR, two fewer outage
   UEs, and +22.5% aggregate DL throughput.
3. The outdoor scalar-gain n258 profile is capacity-saturated and therefore
   insensitive to the map change in aggregate throughput.
4. One old/new realization comparison cannot establish expected coverage
   deltas. Multi-seed confidence intervals are required for that claim.
5. The RMa change warrants explicit owner review before candidate maps become
   production defaults.

## Activation options

1. Keep legacy maps as production and retain v2 as opt-in.
2. Activate v2 maps for all canonical profiles.
3. Activate moderate-delta profiles first and retain legacy RMa pending a
   multi-seed review.

Production activation remains pending owner approval.
