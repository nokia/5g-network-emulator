Rates are Mbit/s. Delivery-window and delivery-gap statistics exclude UEs classified as permanent PHY outage. A PHY-outage UE has MCS below zero in at least 99% of post-warm-up radio samples.

A zero-delivery window has positive offered traffic and no delivered payload in that non-overlapping window. This avoids interpreting every unassigned TTI as user starvation.

The delivery-gap distribution in the table is the distribution of each non-outage UE's maximum observed gap inside contiguous positive-offer segments. It is not a queue-backlog or scheduler-starvation metric. Pooled gap quantiles remain available in the CSV.

Grid assigned/effective values are fractions of physically available frequency-time units. Per-TTI summaries separate TDD-unavailable, available-but-empty, and assigned-with-zero-effective-payload units.

Payload/grant efficiency is sampled from logged grid grants and is the sum of effective payload bits divided by nominal grant bits.
